# Global Game Jam 2020
## Theme: **REPAIR**

## Install
Executable is located into the directory `game/`
On Windows you might need to install some redistributables.
On OSX, don't execute by double-clicking. Go to your terminal and execute from there. You might have to `chmod +x` it for security reason.

## Controls
Escape - Pause/Unpause
Alt+F4/Cmd+Q - Quit
W,A,S,D - Move
Left Mouse - Interract / Repair

## Build
On Windows you need Visual Studio and CMake installed. Run `build_win32.bat`.
On Mac you need a compiler and CMake installed and possibly other dependencies (OpenGL, Glew, etc). Install what ever cmake barfs about. Run `build_osx.sh`
On Linux is should work just as on Mac, but hasn't been tested in a long time.
